## Bio

I am a sophomore psychology major expecting to graduate in 2027. I love clinical work, neuroscience, and research methodology, including frequentist and Bayesian statistics, neuroscience, and computational psycholinguistic studies/machine learning. I am also a firm supporter and practitioner of open science. I enjoy working with marginalized populations, including people experiencing homelessness and neurodivergent populations and people with disabilities; my clinical focus will be personality disorders and complex trauma through a developmental lens and psychodynamic framework. I think it is important to help the marginalized and improve the current treatment model, which is driven by the insurance system.
