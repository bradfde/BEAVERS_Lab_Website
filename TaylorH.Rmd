## Bio

I am born and raised on the Iowa side of the Quad Cities. 

In 2008, I went to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and studied biomedical engineering. Although the math, physics, and biology were interesting in their own right, they did not satisfy my longing for vocation.  I drifted toward human factors engineering, as it looped in psychology and philosophy.  After three years, I transferred to Iowa State for a year with more interest in philosophy and psychology.

In 2020, I began studying at Oregon State University to pursue an undergraduate degree in psychology; and am looking to graduate in June 2025.

I work as an outreach coordinator at First Christian Church in Corvallis, although I am not part of the congregation.  The organization supports the Corvallis Daytime Drop-in Center (CDDC) & Street Outreach Response Team (SORT), Stone Soup & WestM, Harm Reduction & Benton County, Jackson Street Youth Services, various recovery groups, and more.

Although I have an enjoyment for math, physics, and biology; my interests lean toward phenomenology (psychosis, sacred space, initiatory processes, art, and meaning-making), threat response states (homeostatic systems, trauma, addiction, and recovery), and the intersection between theory and practice. 

The BEAVERS lab is an exceptional opportunity to try to study autonomous patterns that we may be less than aware of, yet hiding in plain sight.
