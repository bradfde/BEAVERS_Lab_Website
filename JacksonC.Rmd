## Bio

Prior to my time at Oregon State, I grew up in a small rural community in eastern Oregon.
Baker City was a nice place to grow up, but it could be a little desolate at times. Without much to
do or see, I found a lot of enjoyment helping out around the community. I came to Oregon State
University to pursue a degree in psychology with the hope of helping others in ways that they
truly need.

Anxiety and addiction are some of the most worrisome diagnoses to date, and yet little
research has been done recently. I hope to assist the foundation of this research and its potential
implications for public health and public perception of addiction.
