## Bio

Hi, my name is JJ! I am half Navajo. I am currently in my junior year of college. I transferred here from Clatsop Community College in Astoria Oregon. I'm majoring in Human Development and Family Sciences. I am hoping to become a mental health professional working with families who are a part of the LGBTQIA+ community or with families who adopted children. This is because I was raised by 2 gay men who are the best dads in the world, and I love them so much.
