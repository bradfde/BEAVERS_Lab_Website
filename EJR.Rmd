## Bio

I graduated from Oregon State University summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Then, I began work with Columbia Care Services as a Qualified Mental Health Associate in residential treatment homes and facilities for adults with mental illness. I intend to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in social work while contributing to research in the field of psychedelic-assisted and integrative therapies. Education and advocacy can assist in overcoming issues of public misinformation, unjust laws, and safe access to efficacious treatment models. When responsibly delivered, entheogen-enabled therapies have been shown to improve behavioral health issues of anxiety, depression, substance use, and trauma. Furthermore, I am very curious to explore what role such therapies might play in the context of neurodegeneration. Through research and direct services, I hope to influence healthcare policy reform in a way that is integrative and well-informed, thus contributing to the wellness of society at large.
