## Bio

Hi everyone! My name is Kirsten, I use she/her pronouns and I am from Rocklin, California. I am graduating this December with my bachelor's degree in Biohealth Sciences and a minor in Psychology. I have plans to apply to medical school in May 2026, alongside the military to pursue a military medicine pathway. I have always had an interest in brain and behavior, and seeing people close to me struggle with addiction has led me to the BEAVERS Lab. Dr. Bradford has been a great mentor for all of us, and I hope to translate my lab skills to the field of neurology or psychiatry.
