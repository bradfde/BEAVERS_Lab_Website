## Bio

I am a graduate student in the BEAVERS Lab. I grew up between New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and I received my Bachelor of Arts from Dickinson College with honors in Psychology and French & Francophone Studies in 2021. 
 
As an undergraduate I assisted in two psychology labs, one evaluating a program designed to reduce the impacts of caregivers’ Substance Use Disorders on children, and the other studying the physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adults. While studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark, I conducted research on the relationship between food insecurity and mental health outcomes in the Danish welfare state. I also independently conducted a study on the relationship between stress, social support, and substance use behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These early research experiences contributed to my broad interest in studying stress, substance use, and mental and physical health disparities. 
 
After graduating from Dickinson, I worked as a clinical research assistant in Shannon Wiltsey Stirman’s FAST Lab at Stanford University and the National Center for PTSD studying PTSD treatment implementation and dissemination before joining the BEAVERS Lab.  
 
My research interests lie in investigating how brain injury and substances—namely alcohol and sugar—can moderate psychophysiological stress responses. More broadly, I am passionate about pursuing research questions aimed at understanding and reducing health disparities.
