## Bio

I’m a volunteer research assistant in the BEAVERS Lab at Oregon State University. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Colorado State University, where I first became interested in how the brain and body respond to stress.

Before joining BEAVERS, I worked in the Work Teams Lab at Colorado State under Dr. Keaton Fletcher, where I helped study how teamwork affects stress and performance. That experience gave me hands-on training in collecting data like heart rate, skin conductance, and breathing patterns.

At Oregon State, I’m helping with studies that look at alcohol use, stress reactivity, and brain activity using EEG and EMG recordings. I’m especially interested in how brain chemistry, like Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Corticotropin Releasing Factors, shape our ability to recover from stress and maintain emotional balance.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring new places. I also love calisthenics, snowboarding, photography, and reading fantasy books.
