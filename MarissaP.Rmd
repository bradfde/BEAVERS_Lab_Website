## Bio

 I graduated from UC Davis, class of 2023 with a B.S. in Psychology (Biology Emphasis) and a minor in Neuroscience. While at UC Davis, I volunteered at the TCAN lab focusing on data entry into the database RedCap. I’m originally from Oxnard, California and have been a post-bacc volunteer for the BEAVERS Lab since September 2023. I also work as an RBAI (Registered Behavior Analysis Interventionist) to provide therapeutic services to kids with autism and/or other developmental disorders. My career goals consist of pursuing a PhD program in psychology and conducting research. I enjoy learning about the neural mechanisms that keep the brain functioning as well as when it’s affected by addiction and neural disorders.
