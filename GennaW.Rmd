## Bio

I have lived on both the east and west coasts of the United States, but ultimately couldnâ€™t stay away from the Pacific Northwest. I obtained my Associate of Science Degree with Psychology Emphasis in 2021 from Linn-Benton Community College and am currently a senior at Oregon State University completing my Bachelor of Science in Psychology. I started volunteering (and eventually working) with a non-profit in the mental health field at age 13 which helped foster my interest in psychology and helped fulfill my passion for helping others. While I have interests in a broad range of topics in the field, I am especially interested in addiction (especially food addiction), perception, motivation, and positive psychology as well as data analysis. I was accepted as a member of Psi Chi and joined the APA as a student member in 2022, and was awarded the Drucilla Shepard Smith Award in 2023. Upon completion of my Bachelor of Science in Psychology, my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Health Psychology, eventually focusing on research relating to food addiction and the impact of nutrition on mental health.
