## Bio

I am an honors Microbiology major with a minor in chemistry and a focus in pre-medicine. After completing my degree, I plan to attend medical school and become a pathologist. I am interested in psychology mostly as it relates to neuroscience and the biological explanations for certain behaviors. 

At Oregon State, I participate in several clubs and activities, including the Integrative Biology Club and intramural tennis in the spring. In my spare time, I volunteer at the community outreach center in Corvallis, providing medical care to community members. I enjoy listening to music and painting when I am not focusing on schoolwork.

I began my research with the BEAVERS lab and Dr. Bradford through the Undergraduate Research Program (URSA) at Oregon State University. I hope to continue my involvement in the lab while I am still living in Corvallis and work with Dr. Bradford to complete my honors thesis.
