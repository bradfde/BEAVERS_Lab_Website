## Bio

I am a senior graduating in spring of 2025 with a major in psychology. After graduation I am looking to gain some more research experience with an interest in psychophysiology, psychotic disorders, and stressor-related disorders. Then, I am planning to go for a PhD in Clinical Psychology. My interests come from topics I have learned about in school, as well as the environment and people I grew up around.

When I am free, I like to keep my body moving through bouldering, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and snowboarding. I also like to spend a lot of time with friends, whether that is out doing something out or just hanging at someoneâ€™s house.
