## Bio

I am an honors Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major with a pre-med option, as well as a minor in psychology. I plan to attend medical school and want to become an Emergency Medicine doctor. I really enjoy psychology and psychopysiological studies. 

On campus I am involved in several clubs including the board of the End Overdose club, I also volunteer at the Crisis Text Hotline. I began working at Salem Health Hospital as a Patient Care Attendant in the summer of 2025. In my free time I enjoy cooking and exploring new cultures and places.

I got involved in the lab through the URSA Engage program and was awarded a grant to do research.
