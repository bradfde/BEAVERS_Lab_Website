## Bio

I am in the class of 2025, studying psychology as my major, with a minor in public health. After finishing my undergraduate degree in psychology, I intend to pursue a PhD in Clinical or Counseling Psychology.

My upbringing in the mountains of Bozeman, Montana, and time spent in Montanaâ€™s rural areas has shaped my research interests in addiction, substance-use disorders, and suicide prevention in rural populations. I am also interested in exploring the application and integration of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in wilderness therapy settings. 

Outside of the classroom and lab, I spend most of my time training and traveling as an athlete on the OSU track and cross-country team, or getting lost in the mountains! I enjoy most things in the great outdoors, particularly running, cycling, skiing, and rock climbing. I also love cooking and baking sourdough bread.
