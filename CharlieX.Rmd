## Bio

I’m an Honors biochemistry and molecular biology major with the pre-med option in the class of 2026. I’m from Klamath Falls, Oregon, and my goal is to attend medical school and study to become a neurosurgeon. I really enjoy neuroscience, and I want to research more on how the brain is affected by psychophysiological compounds. 

I became involved in the lab through the URSA Engage program and I was also awarded funding through the Undergraduate Research Experience program to do paid lab work during the summer of 2024.
