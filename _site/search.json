I’ve had a few\n          research experiences during my time as an undergraduate, both\n          in the clinical and empirical realms. After working with\n          Dr. Bradford, my interest in psychophysiology has become\n          prominent. I am passionate about learning about and treating\n          addiction, trauma and psychopathological disorders (e.g.,\n          anxiety).\n          In the future, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Clinical\n          Psychology, and eventually working to re-frame the thinking\n          and structure of clinical treatment as a whole.\n          I am also passionate about mental health advocacy,\n          awareness and destigmatization of mental health issues. As an\n          undergraduate, I was a peer educator with an organization\n          called COPE (Counseling Outreach Peer Education). We worked to\n          bridge the gap between the University of Miami Counseling\n          Center and student body by creating and implementing various\n          outreach materials and presentations in an effort to raise\n          awareness and access to information surrounding such topics. I\n          gained a strong sense of community from my experience in COPE,\n          as well as prioritizing empathy and acceptance above all\n          else.\n          \n          \n          Education\n          University of Miami | Coral Gables,\n          Florida\n          B.S. in Psychology | August 2017 - May 2021\n          \n          \n          Interests\n          Addiction and trauma research\n          Emotional regulation and psychopathology\n          Yoga, mindfulness and meditation\n          Drawing, painting and digital art\n          Reading, writing and music\n          My cat, Momo :)\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Angelica DeFalco, B.S.

I’m a part of the RISE and SUN psychology labs and\n              hope to pursue a doctorate and, eventually, a career in\n              psychological research focusing on the neurological\n              mechanisms of substance use, mental illness, and trauma. I\n              love psychology and am excited to be able to contribute to\n              research I’m passionate about as an undergraduate. Outside\n              of psychology, I’m involved with the OSU Theatre\n              department and design the lighting for their shows as a\n              hobby. I’m very grateful that I get to interact with\n              people who have different interests and goals from\n              mine.\n              \n              \n              Education\n              Oregon State University | Corvallis,\n              Oregon\n              Psychology | Expected June 2024\n              \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n    ",

In\n          January 2020, I joined the Department of Psychology at the\n          University of Miami as a new Assistant Professor where I\n          provided clinical supervison to graduate student clinicians,\n          taught graduate courses on statistics and experimental design,\n          and undergraduate courses on addictive behaviors and research.\n          In Janurary 2022, I fully joined the School of Psychological\n          Sciences at Oregon State University as an assistant professor\n          in the Health Psychology program.\n          My program of research takes a multi-measure experimental\n          psychopathology approach to better understand the role of\n          stress reactivity in mental health. My research focuses on\n          psychological processes at the interface of affect and\n          addiction. My lab uses novel experimental tasks with precise\n          manipulation of laboratory stressors, pharmacological\n          challenges and psychophysiological measures that allow for\n          tight translation between animal and human research. While our\n          work is with people, our approach builds on preclinical\n          findings in animals to identify specific stressor\n          characteristics and neurobehavioral, cognitive, and affective\n          mechanisms of reactivity to those stressors that are critical\n          for understanding of stress reactivity in human\n          psychopathology. This mechanistic understanding may provide\n          novel targets for prevention and treatment of the adverse\n          impacts of acute and chronic drug use as well as comorbid\n          anxiety and depression.\n          I am also passionate about the empirical refinement of\n          psychophysiology methods and the improvement of clinical\n          psychological science as a whole. As such, another branch of\n          my research involves empirical studies designed to verify and\n          increase the robustness and reliability of psychophysiological\n          tasks and measures, so researchers can continue to refine them\n          to maximize their utility in studying affect and\n          psychopathology.

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a new psychophysiological research lab in the School of Psychological Science at Oregon State University. We take a multi-method experimental approach to studying the affective and emotional responses to stressors and how commonly used drugs change those responses. We study the mechanisms of these responses by assessing their neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral components. We want to learn how responses to stressors play a role in mental health challenges such as addiction and anxiety so, eventually, we can better treat such challenges. Because we want to get to the truth in our research, we approach our work with an eye to rigor, equity, and replicability consistent with the “reproducibility revolution” and open science movement.\n\n\n NOTE: The deadline for the 2023 application cycle for the Health Psychology PhD program has passed. Please check back next year for changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It should be noted that the psychology programs at Oregon State University are competitive. As such, successful applicants typically have higher than average GPAs, GRE scores and at least 1 year of research experience. It is also preferable to have strong letters of recommendation. Though authorship on publications are not expected, some demonstration of scientific writing ability and/or presentation experience is preferred. All that said, Dr. Bradford does read and consider all applications fully. If you have strong interest in our lab and believe your application would be considered less competitive for any of the reasons above, please either ask one of your letter writers to address this in their recommendation or speak to this in your personal statement.\nMore specific to our lab, applicants that appear familiar with the research we are doing and have interests that are aligned with our current research will be most competitive. Because our lab uses modern and sophisticated methods, applicants must be interested in learning about and acquiring the necessary expertise to use computing programs such as R and MATLAB. Finally, applicants with interest in Open Science theory and practice will fit best with our lab. Prospective students are encouraged to contact Dr. Bradford with any questions. You can apply to the psychology graduate programs at Oregon State\nhere.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Our program of research takes a multi-measure experimental psychopathology approach to better understand the role of stress reactivity in mental health. In this research, we focus on psychological processes at the interface of affect and addiction. We use novel experimental tasks with precise manipulation of laboratory stressors, pharmacological challenges and psychophysiological measures that allow for tight translation between animal and human research. Though we study human populations, our approach builds on preclinical findings in animals to identify specific stressor characteristics and neurobehavioral, cognitive, and affective mechanisms of reactivity to stressors key in the understanding of stress reactivity in human psychopathology. This mechanistic understanding may provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of acute and chronic drug use as well as comorbid anxiety and depression.",

Following chronic and heavy use in rodents, neuroadaptation in these pathways appears to increase this defensive reactivity. We contribute to a theoretical framework suggesting that this neuroadaptation occurs in human addiction as well, with increases in negative affect and other reactivity motivating more drug use. Indeed, humans have used drugs such as alcohol for millennia to alleviate acute negative affective and other responses to psychological stressors; however, alcohol does not diminish reactivity to all stressors equally.\nIn fact, the stressor characteristics that contribute most to alcohol’s stress dampening effects remain unclear despite 30 years of observational and experimental research. As such, clear evidence for alcohol’s effects on stressor reactivity, which may serve as the first step in alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in humans, is elusive. In addressing this gap, we have noted that the neural structures (e.g., sub-nuclei within the central extended amygdala) and transmitter systems (e.g., corticotropin releasing factor and norepinephrine) involved in animal addiction models overlap with those that modulate defensive reactivity during uncertain stressors. This defensive reactivity is measured using the innate, cross species, startle response to auditory probes during presentation of visual “threat cues” that signal delivery of both certain and uncertain stressors. The startle response during threat cues is potentiated above responses during no-threat cues (i.e., startle potentiation). Anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) have a greater dampening effect on startle potentiation during uncertain vs certain stressors in humans. Using startle potentiation with complementary measures of affect and attention such as Event Related Potentials (ERPs), our lab conducts programmatic studies to test for neuroadaptations in humans by examining:\nThe effects of commonly used drugs on stressor-relevant mechanisms in healthy, non-dependent recreational users and\nEvidence of adaptations or other perturbances in these stressor mechanisms in drug-dependent samples.\nWe also maintain supplementary focus on empirical refinement of psychophysiology methods and the improvement of clinical psychological science broadly.\nWe recognize that substantive advancement in my main areas of research requires rigorous, transparent, and programmatic practices.\nHow and What\nCircumstances that allow commonly used drugs to reduce reactivity to stressors\n\nIn a study published in Psychological Science (discussed in an accessible way in an article by the Huffington Post), we tested the hypothesis that alcohol would have a greater stress reducing effect during stressors of uncertain versus certain intensity. We administered various doses of alcohol to manipulate participants’ blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) across a broad range of levels from sobriety to moderately high intoxication (approximately six standard drinks over 1 hour in a 180-pound man). We used startle potentiation and self-reported anxiety to index objective and subjective reactions to high, low, and uncertain intensity stressors.\nAs you can see in the figure above, certain high intensity stressors elicited greater negative affect than certain low intensity stressors. This appears to confirm the old proverb, “better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know”. Alcohol’s effects on participants’ stress response were robust and linear across all stressor types with higher alcohol doses leading to lower stress response. Alcohol’s effects on stress response were comparable across the high and low intensity stressors. However, we demonstrated that greater alcohol stress response dampening occurs during stressors of uncertain intensity compared to that during stressors of certain high and low intensity.\nIntoxicated drinkers may be less anxious about “the devil they don’t know” than about “the devil they know,” which in turn may lead to increases in certain types of risk taking when people drink. Of note, compensatory neuroadaptation in the response to uncertain stressors following chronic alcohol or other drug use and early chronic stress have been implicated in addiction. While most of this work has used animal models, our results represent a first step towards demonstration of the initial press for such neuroadaptation in humans following acute alcohol use.\nProbing for Evidence\nPossible neuroadaptations in stress circuits\n\nAlcohol administration studies such as the one described above provide evidence in humans for the first component of neuroadaptation of uncertain stressor reactivity implicated by rodent models of drug dependence. In another study published in Journal of Abnormal Psychology, we examined startle potentiation during uncertain and certain stressors in a sample of recently abstinent (1-8 weeks) alcoholics and non-alcoholic controls. We found that individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) show exaggerated defensive response to uncertain but not certain stressors. This provided novel preliminary support for later stage uncertainty-relevant stress neuroadaptations seen in rodent models. Practically speaking, excessive use of alcohol when “drinking to cope” may lead to exaggerated stressor reactivity, which, in turn, may cause, maintain, or exacerbate AUD and related disorders.\nEmpirically Based Improvement\nSeeking to improve research paradigms in psychophysiology and psychological science\n\nConcerns from the research community and public about the replicability of psychological science have spurred calls to increase the rigor and transparency of our field. Increased attention to racism and challenges to equity brought about by ongoing tragic events have opened many people’s eyes to the need for improved equity in psychological science. We attempt to answer these calls in a number of ways. For example, by using increasingly larger and more diverse sample sizes in experimental paradigms with all relevant physiological processing and analysis parameters preregistered and all data shared openly. We have also published empirical studies providing evidence-based approaches to establishing proper quantification and measurement of psychophysiological signals used to study psychological processes. Psychophysiological tasks such as the ones used in our research are poised to become a major contribution to NIMH RDoC and related initiatives in experimental medicine. They also align well with NIMH’s current priorities in experimental therapeutics including focus on mechanisms in clinical trials and the use of surrogate end points for treatment development, and endophenotype identification.\nFor these tasks to contribute meaningfully, however, proper standards for their measurement and quantification must be established. Furthermore, their psychometric properties must be understood for them to be well positioned as tools in psychological research.\nOur efforts thus far have contributed to a clear and comprehensive empirical evaluation of the advantages and limitations of combinations of several measures, tasks, and quantification approaches used in affective and clinical science. In addition to empirical studies, we contribute to methodological themed commentaries published in high profile outlets such as Nature Human Behavior and Neuropsychopharmocology.Recently, we have begun to examine challenges to equity in psychophysiology such as the over use of non-diverse samples and methods that preclude participation from specific communities.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThough science is fun and exciting, it can also be hard and stressful. Individuals also have their own unique challenges intrinsic to their circumstance. Our lab is committed to viewing each member as a whole person with a life both inside and outside of the lab. We operate from the assumption that in a person’s life—and perhaps during their time in our lab—there will be significant life stressors. Our mindset is that in order to have successful and meaningful careers, these stressors cannot be ignored. Rather, each individual and all of their stories are to be accepted and integrated in the fiber of our lab. By joining the lab, you are committing to the spirit of this community and its fellow lab members.\nDr Bradford’s mentoring style:\nAs the director of this lab, I am committed to supporting each member first and foremost as a complex, evolving, human being. I prioritize being available to lab members during both regular and often non-regular hours. In my view, this availability does not end when a lab member graduates or moves out of the state. I stay connected to many of my previous mentees for many years after the formal mentoring relationship has completed. I believe it is a mentor’s responsibility to be flexible and adjust to mentee’s needs within the mentoring relationship. This adjustment includes both the mentor and mentee finding the best way to communicate with one another. None of this means that I will not encourage lab members to grow and become independent. In fact, I have high expectations for and place large responsibility on lab members. I simply commit to supporting lab members as they carry and foster those expectations and responsibility.\nThe science we do in the lab is complex. I believe it is crucial to present this material in the clearest possible way. Despite some of the words used in the research descriptions on this website, I am careful to avoid scientific jargon and make attempts to use plain language in the lab. While helping lab members to strive for a fuller understanding of the data they consume, I encourage them to look for bias in the ways data may be presented in media reports that can obscure important shortcomings or caveats to our and others’ research.\nI am very proud to have been fortunate enough to have my mentoring recognized several times. I received the 2017 Excellence in Undergraduate Mentoring Award from the Office of the Provost at University of Wisconsin, Madison. My contributions to mentoring students from diverse backgrounds was also recognized by the Multicultural Graduate Network with an honorable mention for their Peer Mentor Award. In 2021, I was awarded both the University of Miami Graduate Faculty Mentor of the Year award and the Psychology Graduate Student Organization Teacher of the Year award. I am new to Oregon State University as of January 2022 so I am happy to provide references to my mentoring by mentees from my previous universities.\nReproducibility, Rigor, Transparency, and Openness:\nFifteen years ago, during a heated debate, my coworker angrily spoke words that still echo in my mind: “Psychology is a pseudoscience.” These words illustrate a common stigma that psychology’s merit is not up to par with the hard sciences, something that threatens the standing of psychological research in the public eye. Today, this threat is amplified by widespread concerns about the reproducibility of psychological science and more broadly, societal shifts towards a “post truth era.” Unfortunately, negative public perception about psychology can also discourage people from seeking much-needed psychological treatment. Consequently, stigma surrounding mental illness persists. Our lab is committed to fighting these issues, among others, through doing careful, rigorous, and transparent science. We aim to increase our understanding of human behavior while simultaneously remaining critical consumers and reliable disseminators of research. Most of our research is programmatic meaning we do multiple studies on the same topic and use careful internal replications. For many of our studies, we preregister our analysis parameters and openly share our data and analysis code.\nSkills and experiences you can gain in our lab:\nIf you are in the lab for at least two semesters, you will have the opportunity to receive instruction and gain valuable experience using multiple tools used in clinical and experimental psychology including both software such as R statistical computing platform and MATLAB as well as psychophysiology measurement techniques such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Event Related Potentials (ERP), Electromyography (EMG) and Electrode Dermal Analysis (EDA). You will also likely have the opportunity to learn psychopharmacology techniques such as safe dosing of ethyl alcohol and measurement of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). All of these skills will be taught with an eye to Open Science practices.\n\n\n\n",
