In\n          January 2020, I joined the Department of Psychology at the\n          University of Miami as a new Assistant Professor where I\n          provided clinical supervison to graduate student clinicians,\n          taught graduate courses on statistics and experimental design,\n          and undergraduate courses on addictive behaviors and research.\n          In Janurary 2022, I fully joined the School of Psychological\n          Sciences at Oregon State University as an assistant professor\n          in the Health Psychology program.\n          My program of research takes a multi-measure experimental\n          psychopathology approach to better understand the role of\n          stress reactivity in mental health. My research focuses on\n          psychological processes at the interface of affect and\n          addiction. My lab uses novel experimental tasks with precise\n          manipulation of laboratory stressors, pharmacological\n          challenges and psychophysiological measures that allow for\n          tight translation between animal and human research. While our\n          work is with people, our approach builds on preclinical\n          findings in animals to identify specific stressor\n          characteristics and neurobehavioral, cognitive, and affective\n          mechanisms of reactivity to those stressors that are critical\n          for understanding of stress reactivity in human\n          psychopathology. This mechanistic understanding may provide\n          novel targets for prevention and treatment of the adverse\n          impacts of acute and chronic drug use as well as comorbid\n          anxiety and depression.\n          I am also passionate about the empirical refinement of\n          psychophysiology methods and the improvement of clinical\n          psychological science as a whole. As such, another branch of\n          my research involves empirical studies designed to verify and\n          increase the robustness and reliability of psychophysiological\n          tasks and measures, so researchers can continue to refine them\n          to maximize their utility in studying affect and\n          psychopathology.

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a new psychophysiological research lab in the School\nof Psychological Science at Oregon State University. We take a\nmulti-method experimental approach to studying the affective and\nemotional responses to stressors and how commonly used drugs change\nthose responses. We study the mechanisms of these responses by assessing\ntheir neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral components. We want to\nlearn how responses to stressors play a role in mental health challenges\nsuch as addiction and anxiety so, eventually, we can better treat such\nchallenges. Because we want to get to the truth in our research, we\napproach our work with an eye to rigor, equity, and replicability\nconsistent with the “reproducibility revolution” and open science\nmovement.\n\n\n NOTE: Dr. Bradford will be reviewing applications for\nthe 2023 graduate student application cycle for the Health Psychology\nPhD program.

First, you should know\n          that I am so famous that I am part of an R package\n          that wasn’t even made by my human! Also, I am the most\n          athletic Great Pyrenees you will ever meet. My breed usually\n          sleeps 18 hours a day but I can run with the best of them.

      "description": "Our program of research takes a multi-measure experimental psychopathology approach to better understand the role of stress reactivity in mental health. In this research, we focus on psychological processes at the interface of affect and addiction. We use novel experimental tasks with precise manipulation of laboratory stressors, pharmacological challenges and psychophysiological measures that allow for tight translation between animal and human research. Though we study human populations, our approach builds on preclinical findings in animals to identify specific stressor characteristics and neurobehavioral, cognitive, and affective mechanisms of reactivity to stressors key in the understanding of stress reactivity in human psychopathology. This mechanistic understanding may provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of acute and chronic drug use as well as comorbid anxiety and depression.",

      "contents": "\n\nContents\nBroad\nBackground\nHow and What\nProbing for Evidence\nEmpirically Based\nImprovement\n\nBroad Background\nRodent addiction models suggest that alcohol and other drugs dampen\nneural pathway activity involved in defensive stressor reactivity.\nFollowing chronic and heavy use in rodents, neuroadaptation in these\npathways appears to increase this defensive reactivity. We contribute to\na theoretical framework suggesting that this neuroadaptation occurs in\nhuman addiction as well, with increases in negative affect and other\nreactivity motivating more drug use. Indeed, humans have used drugs such\nas alcohol for millennia to alleviate acute negative affective and other\nresponses to psychological stressors; however, alcohol does not diminish\nreactivity to all stressors equally.\nIn fact, the stressor characteristics that contribute most to\nalcohol’s stress dampening effects remain unclear despite 30 years of\nobservational and experimental research. As such, clear evidence for\nalcohol’s effects on stressor reactivity, which may serve as the first\nstep in alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in humans, is elusive. In\naddressing this gap, we have noted that the neural structures (e.g.,\nsub-nuclei within the central extended amygdala) and transmitter systems\n(e.g., corticotropin releasing factor and norepinephrine) involved in\nanimal addiction models overlap with those that modulate defensive\nreactivity during uncertain stressors. This defensive reactivity is\nmeasured using the innate, cross species, startle response to auditory\nprobes during presentation of visual “threat cues” that signal delivery\nof both certain and uncertain stressors. The startle response during\nthreat cues is potentiated above responses during no-threat cues (i.e.,\nstartle potentiation). Anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) have a\ngreater dampening effect on startle potentiation during uncertain vs\ncertain stressors in humans. Using startle potentiation with\ncomplementary measures of affect and attention such as Event Related\nPotentials (ERPs), our lab conducts programmatic studies to test for\nneuroadaptations in humans by examining:\nThe effects of commonly used drugs on stressor-relevant mechanisms\nin healthy, non-dependent recreational users and\nEvidence of adaptations or other perturbances in these stressor\nmechanisms in drug-dependent samples.\nWe also maintain supplementary focus on empirical refinement of\npsychophysiology methods and the improvement of clinical psychological\nscience broadly.\nWe recognize that substantive advancement in my main areas of\nresearch requires rigorous, transparent, and programmatic practices.\nHow and What\nCircumstances that allow commonly used drugs to reduce reactivity\nto stressors \nIn a study published in Psychological\nScience (discussed in an accessible way in an article by the Huffington\nPost), we tested the hypothesis that alcohol would have a greater\nstress reducing effect during stressors of uncertain versus certain\nintensity. We administered various doses of alcohol to manipulate\nparticipants’ blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) across a broad range of\nlevels from sobriety to moderately high intoxication (approximately six\nstandard drinks over 1 hour in a 180-pound man). We used startle\npotentiation and self-reported anxiety to index objective and subjective\nreactions to high, low, and uncertain intensity stressors.\nAs you can see in the figure above, certain high intensity stressors\nelicited greater negative affect than certain low intensity stressors.\nThis appears to confirm the old proverb, “better the devil you know than\nthe devil you don’t know”. Alcohol’s effects on participants’ stress\nresponse were robust and linear across all stressor types with higher\nalcohol doses leading to lower stress response. Alcohol’s effects on\nstress response were comparable across the high and low intensity\nstressors. However, we demonstrated that greater alcohol stress response\ndampening occurs during stressors of uncertain intensity compared to\nthat during stressors of certain high and low intensity.\nIntoxicated drinkers may be less anxious about “the devil they don’t\nknow” than about “the devil they know,” which in turn may lead to\nincreases in certain types of risk taking when people drink. Of note,\ncompensatory neuroadaptation in the response to uncertain stressors\nfollowing chronic alcohol or other drug use and early chronic stress\nhave been implicated in addiction. While most of this work has used\nanimal models, our results represent a first step towards demonstration\nof the initial press for such neuroadaptation in humans following acute\nalcohol use.\nProbing for Evidence\nPossible neuroadaptations in stress circuits \nAlcohol administration studies such as the one described above\nprovide evidence in humans for the first component of neuroadaptation of\nuncertain stressor reactivity implicated by rodent models of drug\ndependence. In another study published in Journal of\nAbnormal Psychology, we examined startle potentiation during\nuncertain and certain stressors in a sample of recently abstinent (1-8\nweeks) alcoholics and non-alcoholic controls. We found that individuals\nwith alcohol use disorder (AUD) show exaggerated defensive response to\nuncertain but not certain stressors. This provided novel preliminary\nsupport for later stage uncertainty-relevant stress neuroadaptations\nseen in rodent models. Practically speaking, excessive use of alcohol\nwhen “drinking to cope” may lead to exaggerated stressor reactivity,\nwhich, in turn, may cause, maintain, or exacerbate AUD and related\ndisorders.\nEmpirically Based\nImprovement\nSeeking to improve research paradigms in psychophysiology and\npsychological science \nConcerns from the research community and public about the\nreplicability of psychological science have spurred calls to increase\nthe rigor and transparency of our field. Increased attention to racism\nand challenges to equity brought about by ongoing tragic events have\nopened many people’s eyes to the need for improved equity in\npsychological science. We attempt to answer these calls in a number of\nways. For example, by using increasingly larger and more diverse sample\nsizes in experimental paradigms with all relevant physiological\nprocessing and analysis parameters preregistered and all data shared\nopenly. We have also published empirical studies providing\nevidence-based approaches to establishing proper quantification\nand measurement of psychophysiological signals used to study\npsychological processes. Psychophysiological tasks such as the ones used\nin our research are poised to become a major contribution to NIMH RDoC\nand related initiatives in experimental medicine. They also align well\nwith NIMH’s current priorities in experimental therapeutics including\nfocus on mechanisms in clinical trials and the use of surrogate end\npoints for treatment development, and endophenotype identification. For\nthese tasks to contribute meaningfully, however, proper standards for\ntheir measurement and quantification must be established. Furthermore,\ntheir psychometric properties must be understood for them to be well\npositioned as tools in psychological research.\nOur efforts thus far have contributed to a clear and comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of the advantages and limitations of combinations\nof several measures, tasks, and quantification approaches used in\naffective and clinical science. In addition to empirical studies, we\ncontribute to methodological themed commentaries published in high\nprofile outlets such as Nature Human\nBehavior and Neuropsychopharmocology.Recently,\nwe have begun to examine challenges to equity in psychophysiology such\nas the over use of non-diverse samples and methods that preclude\nparticipation from specific communities.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThough science is fun and exciting, it can also be hard and\nstressful. Individuals also have their own unique challenges intrinsic\nto their circumstance. Our lab is committed to viewing each member as a\nwhole person with a life both inside and outside of the lab. We operate\nfrom the assumption that in a person’s life—and perhaps during their\ntime in our lab—there will be significant life stressors. Our mindset is\nthat in order to have successful and meaningful careers, these stressors\ncannot be ignored. Rather, each individual and all of their stories are\nto be accepted and integrated in the fiber of our lab. By joining the\nlab, you are committing to the spirit of this community and its fellow\nlab members.\nDr Bradford’s mentoring style:\nAs the director of this lab, I am committed to supporting each member\nfirst and foremost as a complex, evolving, human being. I prioritize\nbeing available to lab members during both regular and often non-regular\nhours. In my view, this availability does not end when a lab member\ngraduates or moves out of the state. I stay connected to many of my\nprevious mentees for many years after the formal mentoring relationship\nhas completed. I believe it is a mentor’s responsibility to be flexible\nand adjust to mentee’s needs within the mentoring relationship. This\nadjustment includes both the mentor and mentee finding the best way to\ncommunicate with one another. None of this means that I will not\nencourage lab members to grow and become independent. In fact, I have\nhigh expectations for and place large responsibility on lab members. I\nsimply commit to supporting lab members as they carry and foster those\nexpectations and responsibility.\nThe science we do in the lab is complex. I believe it is crucial to\npresent this material in the clearest possible way. Despite some of the\nwords used in the research descriptions on this website, I am careful to\navoid scientific jargon and make attempts to use plain language in the\nlab. While helping lab members to strive for a fuller understanding of\nthe data they consume, I encourage them to look for bias in the ways\ndata may be presented in media reports that can obscure important\nshortcomings or caveats to our and others’ research.\nI am very proud to have been fortunate enough to have my mentoring\nrecognized several times. I received the 2017 Excellence in\nUndergraduate Mentoring Award from the Office of the Provost at\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison. My contributions to mentoring students\nfrom diverse backgrounds was also recognized by the Multicultural\nGraduate Network with an honorable mention for their Peer Mentor Award.\nIn 2021, I was awarded both the University of Miami Graduate Faculty\nMentor of the Year award and the Psychology Graduate Student\nOrganization Teacher of the Year award. I am new to Oregon State\nUniversity as of January 2022 so I am happy to provide references to my\nmentoring by mentees from my previous universities.\nReproducibility, Rigor, Transparency, and\nOpenness:\nFifteen years ago, during a heated debate, my coworker angrily spoke\nwords that still echo in my mind: “Psychology is a pseudoscience.” These\nwords illustrate a common stigma that psychology’s merit is not up to\npar with the hard sciences, something that threatens the standing of\npsychological research in the public eye. Today, this threat is\namplified by widespread concerns about the reproducibility of\npsychological science and more broadly, societal shifts towards a “post\ntruth era.” Unfortunately, negative public perception about psychology\ncan also discourage people from seeking much-needed psychological\ntreatment. Consequently, stigma surrounding mental illness persists. Our\nlab is committed to fighting these issues, among others, through doing\ncareful, rigorous, and transparent science. We aim to increase our\nunderstanding of human behavior while simultaneously remaining critical\nconsumers and reliable disseminators of research. Most of our research\nis programmatic meaning we do multiple studies on the same topic and use\ncareful internal replications. For many of our studies, we preregister\nour analysis parameters and openly share our data and analysis code.\nSkills and experiences you can gain in our lab:\nIf you are in the lab for at least two semesters, you will have the\nopportunity to receive instruction and gain valuable experience using\nmultiple tools used in clinical and experimental psychology including\nboth software such as R statistical computing platform and MATLAB as\nwell as psychophysiology measurement techniques such as\nElectroencephalogram (EEG), Event Related Potentials (ERP),\nElectromyography (EMG) and Electrode Dermal Analysis (EDA). You will\nalso likely have the opportunity to learn psychopharmacology techniques\nsuch as safe dosing of ethyl alcohol and measurement of Blood Alcohol\nContent (BAC). All of these skills will be taught with an eye to Open\nScience practices.\n\n\n\n",
