## Bio

I'm a second-year, junior level student.  I grew up in Canby, Oregon in the country area and spent a lot of my time doing outdoor activities.  I'm majoring in Psychology, with a minor in Spanish. I'm interested in researching bio-psychological subjects, and behavioral phenomenons.  This will be my first year doing research, and I am very excited to start my career path to my Psy.D degree. I am passionate about de-stigmatizing the talk around mental health, the difficulties that come with experiencing mental illnesses, and normalizing talking about therapy.
