## Bio

I am a Psychology PhD student in the Clinical Science track. I began conducting psychophysiology research as an undergraduate at the University of Vermont and continued this work as a post-baccalaureate research assistant. My previous research has utilized psychophysiology to examine prognostic treatment factors for seasonal affective disorder, how trauma exposure impacts neural mechanisms underlying memory and emotion, and the neural mechanisms underlying decision making in individuals with hoarding disorder and anxiety disorders.

Currently, I am interested in using psychophysiological methods to better understand the role of stressor reactivity in addiction and how stressor reactivity is impacted by concussion. I am committed to improving rigor and transparency in psychophysiological research by using multiverse analysis to examine how analytic decisions influence scientific findings. I hope to conduct work that can positively impact policy and healthcare.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with my dog Piper, distance running, hiking, skiing, and baking.
