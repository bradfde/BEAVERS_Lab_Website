## Bio

I am a Psychology PhD student in the Clinical Science track. I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2020 with a double major in psychology and sociology with a concentration in criminal justice. While at UVM, I served as an undergraduate RA for two years in the Rohan lab using psychophysiology to investigate prognostic treatment factors for seasonal affective disorder. After graduation, I served as a post baccalaureate RA at the Anxiety Disorders Center (ADC) investigating the neural mechanisms underlying decision making in people with hoarding disorder and anxiety disorders. After two years at the ADC, I joined the Neuro-Cognition and Emotions Lab at New York State Psychiatric Institute to conduct research investigating the emotion and memory brain processes among those who were exposed to 9/11 as children and adolescents.

I am interested in using psychophysiological methods to better understand the relationship between stress response, affect and addiction. I hope to conduct work that can positively impact policy and healthcare. Additionally, I am interested in reducing inequities within psychophysiology research.

In my free time, I love having out with my dog Piper, distance running, hiking, skiing and baking.
