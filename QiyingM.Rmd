## Bio

I am a  BioHealth Sciences major with a pre-pharm option in the class of 2026. I am from Portland, Oregon. My career aspiration is to become a pharmacist. While pharmacy is my primary focus, I have developed a deep interest in neuroscience and psychology through coursework. I aim to dedicate my strengths to raising awareness about mental health in minority groups.

On campus, I am involved in MAPS, an organization dedicated to assisting minority students in navigating higher education. Being a part of the STEM leader program, I have the opportunity to work in Dr. Daniel Bradford’s lab, where I will delve into the ever-evolving field of neuropsychology to understand the brain’s response to stressors.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a passion for photography and capturing life's moments. Additionally, journaling has been a significant part of my life for the past eight years. I enjoy incorporating collage into my journaling process as a way to explore my artistic side. This practice helps me reflect on and preserve the precious moments of my daily life.
