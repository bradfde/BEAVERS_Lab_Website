## Bio

I’m an Honors Psychology major with a minor in medical humanities. I’m also a
part of the Applied Social Cognition lab studying physician-AI interactions in
healthcare settings. On campus, I co-founded the Kidney Disease Screening
Awareness Program hosting several set-ups in the Corvallis and Salem area. I also
serve as a Beavers Belong Support Leader engaging in weekly peer support
sessions, and I’m a volunteer for IMPACT. Outside of class, I’m involved with the
Global Formula Racing team, assisting in projects related to engine-work and
marketing. I’m fascinated in exploring biopsychological and social determinants
in medicine, focusing primarily on medical ethics, empathy, and accessibility in
patient-centered care. In the future, I aspire to attend medical school and pursue
psychiatry
