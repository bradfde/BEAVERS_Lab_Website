## Bio

In 2024, I completed my undergraduate studies at Oregon State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology with minors in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My main interest is Neuroscience, specifically how trauma affects connections within the brain and how to repair neuronal networks associated with mental health disorders such as addiction. I have always been curious about how people interact on both conscious and unconscious levels. I plan to further investigate Psychoplastenogens, Neurotechnology, and the Neurobiology of Trauma, Addiction, and Consciousness, in hopes of expanding mental health treatment options and accessibility.
