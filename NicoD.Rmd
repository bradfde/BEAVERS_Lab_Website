## Bio

I am currently a junior at Oregon State University studying Psychology. I am a Bay
Area native, graduating from De La Salle high school (Concord, CA) in 2020. My main interest
is Neuroscience, specifically how psychotropic substances affect connections within the brain. I
have always been curious about how people interact on both conscious and unconscious levels.
My main goal is to educate others on how they work(thoughts, emotions, behaviors), and how
external stimuli affect our internal state on a chemical level. I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in
Neuroscience after gaining experience in the research field.
